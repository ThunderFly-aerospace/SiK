The directories conf_Si1060_26MHz and conf_Si1060_30MHz contain configuration headers for the Si1060 chip. They were generated by the Silicon Labs WDS tool for hardware fitted with 26 MHz and 30 MHz crystals, respectively.

The firmware build regenerates the radio configuration header on demand. The helper script supports selecting the desired header set explicitly, e.g.:

    ../../Firmware/tools/build_si446x_table.py --config-dir conf_Si1060_30MHz --output ../../Firmware/radio/radio_446x_conf.h

Adjust the --config-dir argument to point to either the 26 MHz or 30 MHz directory when regenerating the table manually.
